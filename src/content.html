        <div class='text'>Of all, kids are an adorable bunch. I love it when they run around me, placing their tiny-winy hands around my huge sinewy trunk. My leaves and branches are too high for them to reach, so once in a while I wiggle my belly a little and drop some flowers on them. Oh the joy their faces reflect! Those careless and innocent giggles are rewarding.

            Then there are boys, the big boys who play cricket in the park. They us me as stumps! Can you believe that?! Stumps, of all things! .Facepalm. The ball keeps hitting my trunk, but that’s ok! I am too strong to let such things hurt me. Happiness of the boys playing is more important.

            I sometimes feel I am very lucky. Oh! Have I already mentioned that in the first para?!  There is this tree just beyond the park boundary. We gossip a lot, glancing at each other over the fence. The other day he was telling me how passersby, specifically men kept peeing on him and some even spit paan onto his trunk. He said even the dogs pee on him. It made him feel very dirty. He then wondered how men, who appeared sensible and intelligent, could behave in the same way as dogs.

            Have I told you about couples visiting the park over weekdays? Yes, they come mostly on the weekdays when there are not too many people around. I watch them sit on the benches in the park, huddled together for hours. I wonder what they do sitting like that. Sometimes I think how wonderful it must be to have a partner like them. Alas! Trees do not have girlfriends to spend time with. We only have friends. Life’s still good.</div>
